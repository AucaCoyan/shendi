## Character generator for Pathfinder second edition (2e)
###### built in python

## About
Hi!, this is a project by AucaCoyan#9411. Contact me at Discord.

**I'm pretty new to programming, so expect a bunch of bugs and a spagetti code.**

For the time being, I have these objectives before I hit the alfa, beta or pre-release (I'll decide that later)

Upcoming development
- Import and export of PF2 characters
- Manage homebrew content


## Other stuff to check

###### There is an [API for Nethys](https://github.com/SargntSprinkles/Pathfinder-2e-API)
I'd be cool if *shendi* could grab data from Nethys and parse it into the database. This would work only for the mechanics currently working on *shendi*, if there is any new mechanic, there will be the need of coding that.
Some kind of "PF-updater" that downloads everything and update the database would also be good.
